# Text Emphasis & Key Terms

## Regular Emphasis

This is regular text with *italic* and **bold** formatting.

This is _italic_ with underscores and __bold__ with double underscores.

## Key Terms (Bold + Wine Color)

Key terms use `**_text_**` which appears in bold wine/red color:

**_algorithm_**, **_data structure_**, **_recursion_**, **_variable_**

Also works inline: The **_time complexity_** of this algorithm is important.

- Regular bullet
- *Italic bullet*
- **Bold bullet**
- **_Key term bullet_**

## Order Matters for Key Terms

**_This is strong-emph (key term)_** - should be RED

_**This is emph-strong (NOT key term)**_ - should be italic bold, NOT red

Triple markers: ***either interpretation*** and ___also either___

# Styled Spans

## Text Colors

Apply colors to inline text:

- [This text is red]{.red} (A-State scarlet)
- [This text is green]{.green}
- [This text is blue]{.blue}
- [This text is orange]{.orange}
- [This text is purple]{.purple}
- [This text is grey]{.grey}
- [This text is yellow]{.yellow}

Inline usage: Important [red warning]{.red} in a sentence.

---

## Highlighted Text

Background highlights for emphasis:

- [Highlighted in red]{.highlight-red}
- [Highlighted in green]{.highlight-green}
- [Highlighted in blue]{.highlight-blue}
- [Highlighted in orange]{.highlight-orange}
- [Highlighted in purple]{.highlight-purple}
- [Highlighted in grey]{.highlight-grey}
- [Highlighted in yellow]{.highlight-yellow}

Inline: Note this [important detail]{.highlight-yellow} in the text.

---

## Key Term Spans

You can also use explicit span syntax:

- [algorithm]{.term} using `.term` class
- [data structure]{.keyterm} using `.keyterm` class (synonym)

These produce the same result as `**_key term_**`.

---

# Definition Lists

Terms in definition lists are automatically styled as key terms:

Algorithm
: A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing a task.

Data Structure
: A specialized format for organizing, processing, and storing data.

Recursion
: A programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem.

Time Complexity
: A measure of how the runtime of an algorithm grows with input size.

---

# Blockquotes

Here's some regular text before the quote.

> This is a blockquote with styled formatting. It has a grey bar on the left side and proper margins. The text is italic.

Here's text after the quote.

## Multi-line Quote

> This is a longer blockquote that spans multiple lines. It demonstrates how the grey bar extends along the entire height of the quoted content.
>
> This quote has multiple paragraphs to show how the styling handles that case.

Back to normal content.

# Footnotes

This slide demonstrates footnotes^[This is a simple footnote with some text.].

Multiple footnotes in one slide^[First footnote.] with different references^[Second footnote.].

Academic citations^[Smith, J. (2025). *A Study of Footnotes*. Journal of Typography, 42(3), 123-145.] work well.

Longer explanations^[This is a longer footnote that contains more detailed information. It spans multiple lines when rendered. The footnote styling makes text 80% of normal size.] are also supported.

---

# Lists

## Unordered Lists

- First item
- Second item with **bold**
- Third item with *italic*
- Fourth item with **_key term_**

## Nested Lists

- Top level item
  - Nested item 1
  - Nested item 2
    - Deep nested item
- Back to top level

---

## Ordered Lists

1. First step
2. Second step with **emphasis**
3. Third step with **_key term_**
4. Final step

## Lists with Footnotes

- First item with a footnote^[Explanation for first item.]
- Second item with a footnote^[Explanation for second item.]
- Third item^[Another helpful note.]

# Multi-Column Layouts

## Equal Width Columns

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Left Column

- First bullet
- Second bullet
- Third bullet

Text in the left column.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Right Column

- Different content
- More items
- Final point

Text in the right column.
:::
:::

---

## Unequal Width Columns

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
### Narrow (40%)

This column takes up less space.

- Shorter lists
- Less content
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
### Wide (60%)

This column has more room for content.

- More extensive bullet points
- Additional details
- Even more content
- And another point
:::
:::

---

## Three Column Layout

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="33%"}
### Column 1

First third of content.

- Item A
- Item B
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
### Column 2

Middle third.

- Item C
- Item D
:::

::: {.column width="34%"}
### Column 3

Final third.

:::

## Aside Content

::: aside
This is an aside block with supplementary information that appears in a distinct style.
:::

Main content continues here with normal formatting.

---

# Code Blocks

Inline code: `variable = value`

Code block with syntax highlighting:

```python
def factorial(n):
    """Calculate factorial recursively."""
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Test the function
result = factorial(5)
print(f"5! = {result}")
```
